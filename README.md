## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

the users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- DOM manipulation

### What I learned
I learned a lot doing this project. I am more confident in manipulating the dom using plain javascript.
I didn't know how to use the drag and drop API before doing this project. Now I have a bit knowledge about it.
 


### Continued development

My codebase is a little messy and I think there is some improvement to make there.
